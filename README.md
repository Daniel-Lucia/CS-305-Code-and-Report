# CS 305 Code and Report Description

This repo contains a report and code from my time in the Software Security course. This course focused on developing, testing, and securing software applications. I learned how to identify vulnerabilities, apply cryptographic techniques, and implement secure coding principles using Java and tools like Maven. The report in this repo is a Vulnerability Assessment Report and Recommendations scenario for a fictitious company called Artemis Financial it describes how to secure their applications against attacks. The code is from a project to implement secure code changes, which included refactoring to HTTPS and fixing vulnerabilities.
