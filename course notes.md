# Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The project's client was Artemis Financial, a financial institution looking to incorporate some additional security into their existing application.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think I did the static testing fairly well and enjoyed testing for potential vulnerabilities in the code. Secure coding is essential to protect not only your client's property/information but the property/information of the users as well. The loss of personal information or trade secrets can cause a great deal of harm to both people and businesses. Making sure we are keeping our software secure helps to keep this crucial information safe and helps protect a company’s reputation in the long run.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The dependency check tool was very helpful, it created a shortcut for detecting vulnerabilities instead of checking each dependency by hand for vulnerabilities.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Through testing, we found that most of the vulnerabilities were caused by using old/outdated libraries so updating the libraries to their most current version would make the software more secure and fix most of the vulnerabilities. More and more vulnerabilities are found every day however so in the future it is important to actively scan for them to make sure our software remains secure. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Through coding the software, I continually ran debugs to ensure that it was functioning properly. After refactoring the code, I ran additional vulnerability tests to check if any new vulnerabilities were discovered.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

One tool I used was stack overflow to see how peers solved similar situations to mine, especially when running into errors in the console. another resource I used was my professor when I ran into trouble I reached out to them which help a lot. It is an important thing to remember to reach out to those with more experience when you have a hard time figuring something out on your own.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

The work I would show from this assignment would be using a hash function to send an encrypted message. Even though it was a short message it is still a great skill to have to be able to encrypt info
